# Warehouse-Dataset
ML Projects Using datasets from R packages 


This project uses built-in dataset from R package found in the code with the files. 
The purpose of this porject is to analyst the warehouse dataset, and preduct levels of productivity using Classification and Regression Models for 
Statistical Inference. 
------------------
Models Used: 

Logistic
Lasso
------------------
Tree Based Models: 

Tree Model + Pruned Tree Model
Random Forest 
Gradient Boosting 
Out of the Bag 
----------------------
Support Vector Machine: 
Radial, Polynomial, and Linear types used. 

Predictions were made using aveage, standard deviations +/- average, maximum value, and minimum value for the significant variables found using the models. 
Results are found on the PDF file.
